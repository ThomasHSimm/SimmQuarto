    "    -  Easy to convert a notebook to multiple formats, including html, powerpoint, pdf, word doc\n",
    "    -  **BUT** Quarto is not possible if installing from non pip sources is an issue (as far as I can tell currently)\n",
    "-  [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is another option I tried\n",
    "    -  but it doesn't seem to have the functionality of fastpages or quarto. \n",
    "-  [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) seems to be the best option within companies with installation issues\n",
