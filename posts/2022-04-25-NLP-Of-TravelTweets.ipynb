    "Tweets were obtained using the twitter API and tweepy more details on twitter and API [here- tweepy](https://thomashsimm.com/twitter/tweepy/python/2022/04/08/Tweepy.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to keep the query simple and just use tweets containing the handle of TUI and Jet2's UK twitter accounts, as shown below. This was mainly because of the API limitation meant experimenting on the best query took away from getting data.\n",

    "I also decided to get tweets from a 3 day period, at first the start of a month and later in the middle. The tweets were focussed on dates around January 2020 (the start of the pandemic), with data obtained up to ~2 years before this and just over 2 years after this to the present (April 2022). And Use the `search_full_archive` call from twitter api. Broadly the call is as shown below.\n",

    "## Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most 'reliable' way to analyse text data is to do a two step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. creating a language model for the data\n",
    "1. using this language model with labelled data to classify different texts\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is shown here https://www.kaggle.com/code/thomassimm/imdb-sentiment-analysis for sentiment analysis (i.e. are reviews positive or negative) of IMDB data. But the labels need not be positive or negative but can be more nuanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for this twitter data there is no labelled data. I could label the data myself but will first try an alternative approach-> the [zero shot](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html) learning method. The advantage is no labelled data is needed nor any prior training. But the accuracy will be reduced without any training as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/images/zsl/gpt3_triviahq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of the method is that it can be used to classify text data by broad labels based on the language model as shown by the example from the link below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sentence = 'Who are you voting for in 2020?'`\n",
    "\n",
    "`labels = ['business', 'art & culture', 'politics']`\n",

    "At this point in analysis the goals are broad, I mainly want to know if I can understand how customers were reacting to the travel restriction changes being imposed on them and how this differed for the two travel companies. So what may be things we would want to classify from the tweets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How happy/unhappy are the customers?\n",
    "1. Is there a change in the number of what would be classed as complaints?\n",
