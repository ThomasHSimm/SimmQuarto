    "    This is your classic EBSD orientation map with a twist in that the orientations are predicted. The colours represent different orientations given by the legend on the left- they are a vector [phi1,Phi,phi2] (MTEX) with each spatial point having it’s own vector. The colours are reconstructed using ARPGE to give a prediction on what the grains would be prior to cooling, based on the rotation matrix between adjacent elements. There are two problems here, defining the orientation relationships (or rotations) between neighbours and reconstructing grains. In the next case we can ignore the first.\n",

    "    This is similar to the above example, but easier to solve as we only need to look at the rotation across one boundary at a time. In the top figure the coloured regions represent a different phase (martensite) with austenite grains and the particular colour what the orientation relationship (OR) is. The lines show the slip systems and the maximum Schmid factor. Basically, some OR are preferred, the direction of the martensite relates to the particular OR and the Schmid factors. \n",

We are averageing based on an orientation criteria. In the top figures are two models that relate to plastic deformation (Schmid factor left and Taylor model right) plotted on to this IPF plot. The bottom two figures represent experimental data of a ‘Damage parameter’ (number of un-indexed points on boundary) of grains after creep deformation of an austenitic stainless steel. Clearly (hopefully), we can see a transition from type with increasing stress and overall plastic deformation. {Some adjustments could be done on the algorithm to create the plots but the main points remain}"

    "    In a similar manner we can average details of a sample based on orientation in a different manner, as shown here. The reason for this averaging is so we can combine EBSD with powder diffraction (X-ray and neutron). Powder diffraction provides useful insights on some parameters connected to EBSD such as texture, plastic deformation and phases. Furthermore, the information can be from larger volumes of the sample (and not just the surface) than EBSD. However, the way it is measured means we have to modify how we combine the data.\n",
