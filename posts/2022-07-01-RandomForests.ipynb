The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests… show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.\n",

You can set n_estimators to as high a number as you have time to train—the more trees you have, the more accurate the model will be. max_samples can often be left at its default, unless you have over 200,000 data points, in which case setting it to 200,000 will make it train faster with little impact on accuracy. max_features=0.5 and min_samples_leaf=4 both tend to work well, although sklearn's defaults work well too.\n",
