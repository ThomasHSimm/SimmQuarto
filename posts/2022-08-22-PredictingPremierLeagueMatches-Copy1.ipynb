    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting results of [English Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) using random forests for the 2017 to 2021 seasons. I will predict whether a result is a win, loss or draw, and then simplify as a binary question- is it a win?\n",
    "\n",
    "From an article about pundit versus gambling company [Pinnacle vs. Mark Lawrenson](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/Soccer/Mark-Lawrenson-vs-Pinnacle-Sports/VGJ296E4BSYNURUB) we have a benchmark to aim for from the 2012 season:\n",
    "- Mark Lawrenson = 52.6% accuracy\n",
    "- Pinnacle traders = 55.3% accuracy\n",
    "- Random guess = 33.3% accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data there are various parameters that can be used. The most important step is to not use data about a current match as a predictor, but for a prediction to be based on stats from previous matches. (A couple of slight exceptions to this are below like who is playing who and where)\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictors used here include:\n",
    "- date of match\n",
    "- home or away\n",
    "- stats from previous matches\n",
    "    - results\n",
    "    - goals scored/conceded\n",
    "    - possession/expected goals etc\n",
    "- who is playing who\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some details on the machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Random Forest [Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) was the main model used for analysis. \n",
    "- Data is trained on years 2017 to 2020 with season 2021 used as validation\n",
    "    - 20% validation / 80% training\n",
    "- Some data cleaning methods were performed and shown in the code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model accuracy = 52% (+-1%)\n",
    "    - So the model is comparable with the results of Mark Lawrenson\n",
    "- The model is okay as it matches the accuracy from an expert pundit. But it does underperform gambing predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Draws are under-represented by the model\n",
    "    - draws predicted was increased by adjusting the input parameter `class_weight` but the issue was only reduced \n",
    "- Changing input parameters was done in a semi-manual manner, obtaining the best input parameters was not easy\n",
    "\n",
    "- The more data the better, \n",
    "    - but the increase from just using a basic four parameter fit to one with 300+ columns is relatively small (a difference of ~1-2% (based on values 50-65%))\n",
    "\n",
    "- By searching for the best hyper parameters the results of a random forest (RF) model were increased from 49% accuracy to 52%\n",
    "\n",
    "- RF, XG boost and grad boost methods all performed similar\n",
    "    - Ridge model was the worst performing\n",
    "    - Neural networks with fastai tabular data also performed poorly. [NN analysis of EPL](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thomassimm/nlp-disaster-nn)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Similar results were obtained by using classification and regression methods\n",
    "    - Regression on the net score performed the best\n",
    "    - Regression methods performed worse on predicting draws though\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Ensembling (combining results from different methods by adding them) can increase the overall results. The accuracy would need to be comparable and the results different enough for their to be a benefit\n",
