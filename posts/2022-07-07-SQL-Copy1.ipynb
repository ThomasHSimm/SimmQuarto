    "# 1 SQL for data science\n",
    "\n",
    "This course gives basic details of SQL. I found it good in general as it was well presented and content was good but some negatives as shown below. It works well within the course though in that the knowledge is built on later particularly in the next course, but on it's own it would leave you guessing how you do some basic SQL by linking the things mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I chose to do this course was because my SQL was poor. I had done a few courses on SQL but they weren't very indepth and I had not practiced what I had learned or obtained good resources to check back on. So when I tried to do some basic SQL beyond basic calls with WHERE or GROUP BY I was stuck. And when I looked for free and good resources they weren't as easily to obtain as with Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Positives:\n",
    "- Greatly improved SQL from both theory and practical assignments\n",
    "- Good increase in difficulty so more is learned and are challenged without getting bored\n",
    "- Well curated to guide me on basics of code, practical exercises and resources on getting better at SQL and resources around SQL (e.g. platforms such as databricks and Spark or links to good resources on SQL in general)\n",
    "\n",
    "Negatives:\n",
    "- Many course were all videos and no text data- I literally had videos on mute and scolled through in time to find the formulae\n",
    "- I don't think courses could be done on their own. For example, course 1 had basics of code but no walk throughs of code on how to link the methods. Whereas, 2 had walk throughs but no basics.\n",
