    "## Setting up twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Apply for a developer account\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before using the Twitter API, you first need a Twitter account, and to have obtained some credentials. The process of getting credentials could change with time, but currently it is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Visit the Application Management page at https://apps.twitter.com/, and sign in with your Twitter account\n",
    "    Click on the \"Create New App\" button, fill in the details and agree the Terms of Service\n",
    "    Navigate to \"Keys and Access Tokens\" section and take a note of your Consumer Key and Secret\n",
    "    In the same section click on \"Create my access token\" button\n",
    "    Take note of your Access Token and Access Token Secret\n",
    "    And that's all. The consumer key/secret is used to authenticate the app that is using the Twitter API, while the access token/secret authenticates the user. All of these parameters should be treated as passwords, and should not be included in your code in plain text. One suitable way is to store them in a JSON file \"twitter_credentials.json\" and load these values from your code when needed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Source [E. Accessing the Twitter API with Python - Mihajlo Pavloski](https://stackabuse.com/accessing-the-twitter-api-with-python/)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Twitter API access levels and versions\n",
    "\n",
    "    While the Twitter API v2 is the primary Twitter API, the platform currently supports previous versions (v1.1, Gnip 2.0) as well. We recommend that all users start with v2 as this is where all future innovation will happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The Twitter API v2 includes a few access levels to help you scale your usage on the platform. In general, new accounts can quickly sign up for free, Essential access. Should you want additional access, you may choose to apply for free Elevated access and beyond. \n",

    "### 2. Create a project/app\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the twitter API you need to create a twitter App. From this you can then get the security IDs, bearer_token, API_key etc.\n",

    "### 3. Set up an environment \n",
