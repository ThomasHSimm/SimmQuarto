    "## What is the Cloud? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, companies and organizations hosted and maintained hardware such as \n",
    "Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. You no longer have to manage and maintain your own hardware in your own data centers. Companies like AWS own and maintain these data centers and provide virtualized data center technologies and services to users over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Six Benefits of Cloud Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pay as you go. Instead of investing in data centers and hardware before you know how you are going to use them, you pay only when you use computing resources, and pay only for how much you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Benefit from massive economies of scale. By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Stop guessing capacity. Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Increase speed and agility. IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.\n",
    " \n",
    "5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers. Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering physical infrastructure. This is often referred to as undifferentiated heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Go global in minutes. Easily deploy your application in multiple Regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost.\n",

    "### Cloud Deployment Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **all-in cloud-based** application is fully deployed in the cloud\n",
    "- **hybrid deployment** using cloud based resources and existing resources such as a data center\n",
    "  \n",

    "## AWS Global Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS serves over 1 million customers in over 190 countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure, like data centers and networking connectivity, still exists as the foundation of every cloud application. In AWS, this physical infrastructure makes up the AWS Global Infrastructure, in the form of Availability Zones and Regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regions** \n",
    "- geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts its data centers\n",
    "- named after the location where they reside. For example, in the United States, there is a Region in Northern Virginia called the Northern Virginia Region\n",
    "- Each AWS Region is associated with a geographical name and a Region code. \n",
    "- Each region is completely independent and isolated from other regions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside every Region is a cluster of **Availability Zones (AZ)**. \n",
    "- An AZ consists of one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. \n",
    "- These data centers operate in discrete facilities with undisclosed locations. - They are connected using redundant high-speed and low-latency links.\n",
    "- i.e. geographically isolated but connected by low-latency (quick) links\n",
    "- placing application in multiple AZs helps prevent service disruption **higher availability** (different utility, power supply, location etc)\n",
    "- us-east-1a: an AZ in us-east-1 (Northern Virginia Region)\n",
    "- At a minimum, you should use two AZs. If one entire AZ fails, your application will have infrastructure up and running in at least a second AZ to take over the traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choose the Right AWS Region\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider four main aspects when deciding which AWS Region to host your applications and workloads: latency, price, service availability, and compliance.\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Latency**. If your application is sensitive to latency, choose a Region that is close to your user base. This helps prevent long wait times for your customers. Synchronous applications such as gaming, telephony, WebSockets, and IoT are significantly affected by higher latency, but even asynchronous workloads, such as ecommerce applications, can suffer from an impact on user connectivity.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. **Price**. Due to the local economy and the physical nature of operating data centers, prices may vary from one Region to another. The pricing in a Region can be impacted by internet connectivity, prices of imported pieces of equipment, customs, real estate, and more. Instead of charging a flat rate worldwide, AWS charges based on the financial factors specific to the location.  \n",
    "3. **Service availability**. Some services may not be available in some Regions. The AWS documentation provides a table containing the Regions and the available services within each one.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. **Data compliance**. Enterprise companies often need to comply with regulations that require customer data to be stored in a specific geographic territory. If applicable, you should choose a Region that meets your compliance requirements.\n",
    "\n",
